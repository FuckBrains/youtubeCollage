I started the process of dockerizing this application in hopes of running it as a container. The API i'm using to upload to youtube seems to include a key which is updated everytime the API is called. I'm not sure how to maintain this value in a docker enviroment. 

I want to include this data in my git incase I ever decide to revist this, but I'm moving on for now.
